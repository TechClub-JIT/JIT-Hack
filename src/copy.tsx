Everything Hack the North provided â€“ inspiring speakers, mentors, workshops, food, coffee and free swag â€“ contributed to an awesome supportive environment that made it really fun to hack away for those 36 hours."

      {
        question: "What if I've never been to a hackathon before?",
        answer:
          "Hack the North welcomes students of all skill levels. In previous years, 30% of students have attended Hack the North as their first hackathon. Weâ€™ll have talks, mentors and workshops to help you with your project; hackathons can be a great place to learn new skills in a short amount of time. Just be eager to learn, and excited to meet lots of awesome people."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I start working on my hack before the event?",
        answer:
          "No. In the interest of fairness, students should not be working on their projects before Hack the North begins and we do not allow participants to work on pre-existing projects. However, you can familiarize yourself with all the tools and technologies you intend to use beforehand! Hardware will also be provided to hackers who fill out hardware request forms made available after they have been accepted to the event."

Whether itâ€™s for relaxation or health, novelty or competition, our team has something exciting prepared for you!"
